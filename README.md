## Dataset
[Spotify-YouTube Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitgrewal/spotify-youtube-data)

## Why did I chose this dataset?

[Honestly, I chose it because I found myself able to ask questions based on the data quite easily. Plus, I listen to music a lot using both YouTube and Spotify, depending on where I am. Having questions like “which top artists do these platforms have in common?” or “how high up is Ado on both platforms?” and having the ability to answer them with this dataset is a big reason in why I chose it!]

## Progress
- [x] Picked dataset
- [x] Defined 10 questions
- [x] Answered 10 questions using Pandas
- [x] Added at least one data visualization (using Matplotlib and/or Seaborn) to each single question
- [ ] Prepared presentation slides to present at graduation

## Questions
- [x] Question 1: "Which of the top 10 artists from each platform do both platforms share?"
  - Answer: "Both platforms share Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Justin Bieber, and Bruno Mars."

- [x] Question 6: "Do tracks with longer durations in milliseconds receive more Spotify streams?"
  - Answer: "No, tracks with longer durations do not receive more Spotify streams. It seems that the longer a track is, it gets slightly fewer streams."
